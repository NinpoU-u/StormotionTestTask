#StormotionTestTask

A small application in which I tried to implement the MVVM architecture, together in cool features like:
- Kotlin 
- Kotlin coroutines
- Retrofit 
- Android jetpack.

The application has many interesting features, I really liked the task from #Stormotion, it seemed to me extremely interesting and free to use. I would also like to note that I did not manage to do everything, did not add google Ad's (adMob) and did not manage to fix the bug in loading the video into the Details fragment.
